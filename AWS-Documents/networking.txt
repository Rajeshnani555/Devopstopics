->virtual Private cloud 
-> using vpc we can create isolated network for our projects in aws cloud 
subnets
Internet gateway
Route table
nat gateway
security group
NACL

->subnet is nothing partition in vpc (subnetwork in large network)
->subnet are 2 types
    1) public subnet
    2) private subnet
->  private subnet means no internet connectivity
-> public subnet means internet connectivity
Note: we will launch our aws resource using vpc and subnets

Internet gateway(IGW)
---------------------
-> Logical connection between internet and amazon vpc
-> every vpc will have its own internet gateway
-> igw is used to allow incoming and outgoing trraffic for vpc
Note: IGT will allow instance with public ip to access the internet

Route Table
-----------
-> Route table is used to configure Routing for subnets with in vpc
-> Every subnet in vpc should connect with Routing table

NAT gateway
-----------
-> NAT gateway is used to restrict incoming traffic and allow outgoing traffic in vpc subnets
-> It allow only one way traffic 
Note: NAT will allow instance with no public ip to access the internet

Security Group
--------------

-> SG is used to configure rules/protocols to allow the traffic
-> SG will not support for DENY

----
-> NACL is usedto configure rules to deny the traffic 
-> NACL will provide additional security for vpc at network level
-> Network Access control list (additional security layer in vpc)

-------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VPC Sizing

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> VPC sizing means allocating IP address for our virtual cloud
-> for example I have taken 100 ips in vpc
         subnet-1 with 1-50 ips
         subnet-2 with 51-100 ips
-> If do vpc sizing like above then all my 100 ips got completed . if i get some new requirement in future
i don't have IPs to launch my resources.

-> To overcome this problem we don't allocate all IP's to subnets
-> we will allocate few IPS to subnets and we will keep few IPS for future purpose (Reserving)

         

IP Ranges
---------

-> IP ranges will be calculated in 2 power
Note: I am using IPV4 version
)
IPV4 
-----
--> IT contains 4 parts (4 octects)
ex 192.134.0.12
--> Every octect contains 8 bits
--.> 4 octetects * 8 bits = 32 bits
--> If we give IP range as/16 => 2 power (32-16) =>2 power 16 => 65536 ips we will get
--> If we give IP range as /32 => 2 power (32-32)=> power  0  => 1 ip we will get
--> if we give ip range as 31 => 2 power (32-31) => power  1  => 2 ips we will get 
--> if we give ip range as 30 => 2 power (32-30) => power  2  => 4 ips we will get 
--> if we give ip range as 29 => 2 power (32-29) => power  3  => 8 ips we will get
--> if we give ip range as 28 => 2 power (32-28) => power  4  => 16 ips we wiil get  
--> if we give ip range as 24 => 2 power (32-24) => power  8  => 256 ips we wiil get  
Note : its is recommended to create ips with range as /24 because it will give 256 ips for us
-------------------
createing vpc with subnets, Route table and internet Gateway

1) go to vpc dashboard and create vpc 
   
  CIDR BLOCK : 10.0.0.0/16 (we will get 0-65535 ips)

2) Under VPC, Create subnet-1a in AZ 1a
CIDR BLOCK : 10.0.0.0/24 (we will get 251 ips, remaining 5 ips aws will reserve) 

3) Under vpc create subnet-1b in AZ lb
    CIDR BLOCK : 10.0.1.0/24 (we will get 251 ips, remaining 5 ips aws will reserve) 
4)Create 2 Route Tables
   Route-Table-1 Associate with subnet-1a
   Route-Table-2 Associate with subnet-1b 

5) Go to Route Table --> Select Route -> Edit Route -> Add the Route to allow all traffic
   Destination 0.0.0.0/0 & Target is Internet Gateway

Note : Do this 5th step for both route tables

6) Create Internet Gateway

7) Attach Internet Gateway to Vpc

8) Create EC2 instance-1 using custom vpc with subnet-1a
              Network -> VPC SELECTION
              Subnet selection -> subnet-1a
              Auto-Assign-public-IP -> Enable 

 9)Create EC2 instance-2 using custom vpc with subnet-1a
              Network -> VPC SELECTION
              Subnet selection -> subnet-1b

              Auto-Assign-public-IP -> Enable

10) Connect To ec2 instance and check connectivity

11 After Testing Stop Ec2 Instance 

-------------------------------------
5 ips will reserver for what purpose
--------------------------------------

10.0.0.255 will reserver for broadcasting (it is blocked for broadcasting)
10.0.0.0-> internel router is configure in this vpc
10.0.0.1-> is for network utility
10.0.0.2 -> is reserved for future use
10.0.0.3 -> is reserved for future use
