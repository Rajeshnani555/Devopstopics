-->EC2 stands elastic compute cloud
-->EC2 service providing virtual machines for aws users
-->using ec2 we can create any no .of virutal machine according to our requirement
Note: Aws providing 1 years free subscription with 750 hours / monthly 
--> EC2 provide scalable computing cloud in aws
Note : if we use ec2 then we no need to purchase physical servers for our infrastructure
Note : one virtual machine is called as one vm or one instance
--> ec2 provide AMI (Amazon machine Images) - per-configured machines
--> we can cusomize instance types (cpu,memory,storage,network, capacity)
--> ec2 providing secured instance with key-pair
Note: Ec2 is regional based service 

--> EC2 providing security groups to manage incoming & outgoing traffic for our instance 
--> Security Group (SG) contains inbound & outbound rules
inbound rules ->  manageing for incoming traffic 
outbound rules ->  manageing for outgoing traffic 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                instance launch types 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) on Demand Instances
2) reserved Instances
3) Spot Instances
4) Dedicated host 

1) on Demand Instances
--> when ever you want you will use it such kind of instances are called on demand instances
--> fixed price (hourly )
--> pay for what you have used
--> no commitment
--> no Prior payment
--> no predictable usage 
2) Reserved Instances
--> Long term commitment
--> Prior payment(Full,Partial)
-->1 0r 3 years
-->75% discount on hourly price
-->perdictable usage 
Spot Instances
--> Bidding (Auctioning)
--> Huge Capacity for cheaper price
Dedicated Instances
--> if any customers need diedcated physical machine
--> Licensed based softwares
Note: Aws cloud minimum billing period is 1 hour
9 am - 10 am ===> used for 5 mins
11am - 12pm ===> userd for 5 mins
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Instance states
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Launch state --> pending stage --> Running state --> stop state --> Reboot state --> Terminate state

                  EC2 INSTANCE Family types
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Amazon ec2 provides us with a wide selection of instance types that are optimized for different use cases.
2) Instance types comprises of varying combination of cpu, memory, storage and networking capacity and this gives us the flexibility to choose the most appropriate mix of resources for the applications.
3)Each instance type include one or more instance size that allows us to scale the resources to the requirments of the target workloads.
4) The instance types can be divided into following 
A) General purpose
B) compute optimized
c) Memory optimized
D) storage optimized 
E) Accelerated computing
F) HPC optimized

A) General purpose

--> General purpose instances provides a balance of compute, memory and networking resources and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads
--> These instances are indeal for applications thast use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.

B) COMPUTE OPTIMIZED 
-->compute optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors
--> instances belonging to this category are well suited for batch processing workloads, mediatrancscoding,high perfomance web server, high performance web server, high performance computing, scientific modeling
--> dedicated gaming servers and machine learning inference and other compute intensive application

MEMORY OPTIMIZED
--> Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast 
performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory 
--> Memory optimized instances are ideal for memory intensive workloads such as open-source databases 
in-memory caches and real-time big data analytics

Storage optimized
-->Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high seqential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
--> They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/o operations per second (IOPS) to applications.
--> These are ideal for I/O intensive applications and are targeted to customers using transactionl databases, Amazon opensearch service and real-time analytics such as Apache spark

Accelerated computing
--> Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform fuctions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics perocessing or data pattern matching, more efficiency that is possible in sfotware runing on cpus.
--> These are ideal for machine learning, high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics,computational finance, seismic analysis,speech recognition,autonomous vehicles and drug discovery.


HPC OPTIMIZED

--> High Performance computing (HPC) instances are purpose built to offer the best price.
Performance for running hpc workloads at scale on aws

--> HPC instances are ideal for applications thsat benefit from high-performance such as large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads.
